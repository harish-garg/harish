My Twitter Play book (as of today*)

- I love getting DMs. And I iniatiate DMs with lots of people.
- I don't do follow-for-follow.
- I hardly follow people back anymore unless I find them very interesting.
- I only follow people that have already followed me.
- Instead of following people, I collect them in various lists. 
If you are doing something interesting, you are in one of my lists and I am checking your tweets daily.
- I keep my lists private. They are  very specific to me and my interests.
- I like lots of tweets. 
- I reply to lots of tweets, espcially the ones I find interesting.
- I rarely retweet and occasionaly quote-tweet.
- I never block or report anybody. It's excessive and waste of time.
- I mute people. Especially the ones that suddenly start tweeting a lot about some topic I have zero interest in.

* This might change in future.
