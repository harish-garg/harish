## About the Guide

The age of commercial AI, available as a cloud API is here. One can call an AI API, like any other Cloud service, and build products around it. 

One of the biggest players in this space is OpenAI. Founders are already starting & building profitable companies, built around products enabled by OpenAI APIs. For Example:

**Copy.AI Crosses $30K MRR in 3 months**

**HeadLime Crosses $6K MRR**

The possibilities of building new products or integrating OpenAI into existing products is limitless.

I am writing this guide to help Product Builders go from Zero to Hero in building products with OpenAI APIs.
