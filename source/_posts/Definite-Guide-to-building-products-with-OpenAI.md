## About the Guide

The age of commercial AI, available as a cloud API is here. One can call an AI API, like any other Cloud service, and build products around it. 

One of the biggest players in this space is OpenAI. Founders are already starting & building profitable companies, built around products enabled by OpenAI APIs. For Example:

**Copy.AI**

**HeadLime**

The possibilities of building new products or integrating OpenAI into existing products is limitless. And this goes beyond for profit products. 

** GPT-3 Written thought Experiments**

You can integrate OpenAI API with your existing products.

I am writing this guide to help Founders, Developers, Product Managers understand what it takes to build products with OpenAI APIs.
