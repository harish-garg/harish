## About the Guide

The age of commercial AI available as a cloud API is here. One can call an AI API, like any other Cloud service and build products around it. 

One of the biggest players in this space is OpenAI. Founders are already starting & building profitable companies, built around products enabled by OpenAI APIs.

Example: Copy.AI Crosses $30K MRR in 3 months

The possibilities of building new products or integrating OpenAI into existing products is limitless.

I am writing a guide to help Product Builders go from Zero to Hero in building products with OpenAI APIs. 

I will be writing this guide in public (thanks to my friend [Kevon Cheung](https://kevoncheung.com/building-in-public) for the inspiration).

This guide is also available in formats suitable for Book Reading Apps and Devices(PDF, ePub, Kindle). If you like and want to support this work, you can [Pre-Order it here](https://gum.co/gpt-3-guide)
