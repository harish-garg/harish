Recently I wrote a Tutorial on [How to Build a GPT-3 Powered Serverless App using NextJS & React?](https://harishgarg.com/writing/how-to-build-a-serverless-gpt-3-powered-using-nextjs-react/). The code for this is open source and available on [Github](https://github.com/harish-garg/nextjs-reactjs-gpt-3)

People reached out to say they found it really useful.

Some had questions about how to implement other use cases with GPT-3. For example.

- Generate emails
- Generate Article Intros 
- Text summarization
- Generate tabular data from text
- Parse text to take out key data, e.g., addresses, names, email ids, phone nos, etc
- Generate Product Descriptions
- Generate YouTube Video Titles & intros
- etc.

I also received few consulting requests for help implement the GPT-3 API in their apps.

That led me to believe there should be a starterkit for building GPT-3 Powered Apps.

Hence,  am building a startkit for GPT-3 Powered Apps. This one uses NextJS/ React / JS. Note: This will not be released as Open Source.

## What you will get
- Source Code for an app that covers mutiple use cases for GPT-3 for NextJS/ReactJS Stack
- ReadMe to how to add your OpenAI API key and setup the App in your local development setup
- How to Push the App Live to Hosting providers like Vercel.

## How to Purchase the starterkit?
I am taking pre-orders, starting now for this starterkit. 

Final Price will be **USD$99**. However, first five people can pre-order it for **USD$49**.
