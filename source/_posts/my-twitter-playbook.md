## Rules I go by when I am on Twitter (as of today*)

### DMs
- I love getting DMs. 
- And I start DMs with lots of people.
- I like getting DMs even more than a follow.

### Follow Back
- I don't do follow-for-follow.
- I make use of lists extensively.
- Instead of following people, I collect them in various lists. 
- If you are doing something interesting, you are on one of my lists and I am checking your tweets daily.
- I keep my lists private. They are very specific to me and my interests.

### Engagement
- I like lots of tweets. 
- I reply to lots of tweets that I find interesting.
- I rarely retweet and sometimes quote-tweet.

### Freedom of Expression
- I believe in Freedom of Expression. You go say whatever you want in your space and I will do the same in mine.
- I never block or report anybody. It's excessive and a waste of time.
- I mute people. Especially the ones that suddenly start tweeting a lot about some topic I have zero interest in.
- I don't do certain topics, including Politics, Religion, Social Activism.
- I do not argue. If I disagree, then the only way I will express is by not engaging.
- No, I will not join in whatever crusade you are running online, no matter your political affiliation.

* This might change in the future.
