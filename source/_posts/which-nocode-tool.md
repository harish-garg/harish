There are a lot of people who want to build MVPs and startups but don't know-how. 

But, this user base is not homogeneous. On one side of the spectrum are people with some computer skills who can make a list in Excel. And then some people know to code but not the right kind to build an MVP without months of learning.

Let's say you are a recruiter and need to put together a job page. Webflow is going to be an overkill for this use case. You are going to get lost in managing the learning curve. Are their No Code tools better suited for this? Yes, there are. Finding them without getting lost in the No Code maize is another matter.

Or, maybe your needs are broader than a job board. You want a wider variety of templates and the ability to connect to a database. And lesser complexity then webflow. The tools here are going to be different.

Let's take it one level up - you already know your way around complex systems and want to build a complex MVP. Well, now we have reached the webflow level. 

So, the question a Maker wants the answer to is - 
"Here is what I know already. Here is what I want to build. Given that, What tool is best for what I want to build?"
